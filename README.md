These notebooks are used self-paced, with teacher introduction to jupyter notebooks at the start for an approximately 17 45-minute class period unit on Python programming with 7th grade students at an independent school for highly capable students. Students have some previous experience programming with Scratch and will go on to program with ArduinoC in the next year.
