When wew program, we use more descriptive variable names. Different families of programming languages have different variable naming conventions. In fact, next year when you learn to program Arduinos you will use ArduinoC which uses a slightly differnt naming conventions. For Pythin, we use underscores to separate words and use variable names that describe what the variable stands for. "
